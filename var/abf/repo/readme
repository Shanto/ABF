# /var/abf/repo

This directory holds all packages built according to what you have configured inside /etc/abf/repo.d/

After successfully running ABF with your repositories and packages configured, you are supposed have a directory structure here as follows:

/var
	/abf
		/repo
			/my-private-repo
				/any
					pkgname-ver-any.pkg.tar.xz
					...
				/i686
					my-private-repo.db...
					pkgname-ver-i686.pkg.tar.xz
					...
				/x86_64
					my-private-repo.db...
					pkgname-ver-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
					...

The next step to consuming or serving these repos is to configure your HTTP/FTP server to serve these files.
