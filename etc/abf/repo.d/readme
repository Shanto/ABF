# /etc/abf/repo.d

For each repository to configure, make a directory with same name here.

	/etc/
		/abf/
			/repo.d/
					/my-public-repo/
					/my-private-repo/
	
	# mkdir -p /etc/abf/repo.d/{my-public-repo,my-private-repo,aurbin}

Similarly, inside the repository directories, create a 0-byte file for each package to be built.

	/etc
		/abf
			/repo.d
				/my-public-repo/
								/yaourt
								/dropbox
								/aurvote
								/tiobench
								/package-query
				/my-private-repo/
								/gam
								/spotify
	
	Examples:

	Some public packages with free license
	# touch /etc/abf/repo.d/my-public-repo/{yaourt,aurvote}

	Some private packages with unknown license
	# touch /etc/abf/repo.d/my-private-repo/{ttf-adobe-fonts,ttf-vista-fonts}

	All locally installed unsupported packages
	# for pkg in $(package-query -Qm -f %n); do
	#	touch /etc/abf/repo.d/aurbin/$pkg
	# done

In future, these files might also be used to provide functionalities like that in `customizepkg`. In that case, these files will contain the customization instructions for the corresponding package.
